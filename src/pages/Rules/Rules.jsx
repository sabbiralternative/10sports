            are not the same for every market on each product. In certain

            example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a
            dead heat or be voided on the other product. Customers must ensure

                The Site&amp;apos;s non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of
                odds on bets already matched when a horse in a race is declared
                a non-runner. In order to make the adjustment the Site applies a
                reduction factor to the remaining runners. The reduction factor
                allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the details of which
                are described below) of that horse&amp;apos;s chances of winning
                (or being placed, etc as appropriate) and is applied to bets
                already matched on the other runners in the relevant market or

                Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does

                When the market is loaded each horse is given a
                &amp;apos;reduction factor&amp;apos;, based on a forecast price,
                which is expressed as a percentage. These reduction factors may
                be updated periodically at the discretion of the Site based on
                trading in the market, but after approximately 15 minutes
                (approximately 5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the
                scheduled &amp;apos;off&amp;apos; time of a given race, they
                will be updated only in exceptional circumstances. The current

                As soon as the Site becomes aware that a horse is an official

                Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck
                in-play. However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by
                error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets
                matched during this time will be subject to any later reduction
                factor, provided the market is turned out of play before the
                race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, the Site
                reserves the right to remove the runner after completion of the
                race. In this case only those bets matched prior to the off will
                be affected by a reduction factor.

                (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or
                less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
                unmatched and matched bets will stand, however if the runner is

                For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a
                non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be applied to all bets
                struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those
                markets of such non-runner by the Site. Likewise, should a
                reserve runner become a confirmed runner but subsequently become
                a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such non-runner
                will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets,
                prior to the removal from those markets of such non-runner by
                the Site.
