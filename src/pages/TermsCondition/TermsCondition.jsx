                17.8. The outcome of a market is settled once this is
                determined. https://www.{Settings.siteTitle}.io takes the right
                to settle the game results in case a market is not determined
                earlier in the game. This rule works in terms of the normal
                duration of the match being concluded and if no any conditions
                are stated in the market description on the Website. For
                example: Example 1: Match-winner 1X2 market of an event is
                determined after the end of the normal duration (regular time)
                of the event. Football (Soccer) 1x2 Match Winner is determined
                after the 90 min, including any extra minutes called by the
                referee of the match as “normal duration”. When the game is
                played in Overtime (the regular time cannot determine the
                winner), all markets state that this is a subject to pay
                “include overtime” after completion of the game. If there are
                any penalty kicks (or other decisive moments) they’re not taken
                into consideration, unless another stated in the market. If the
                beginning of the game is delayed for whatever reasons, the event
                can be kept open and all bets can remain open 48 hours from the
                official start time. Nevertheless, https://www.
                {Settings.siteTitle}.io reserves the right to void such bets on
                its direction and refund the Users’ stakes back. All bets can
                remain open and be calculated due to the game results by the
                decision of https://www.{Settings.siteTitle}.io when the
                organizer continues the abandoned event within 48 hours after
                starting time. In case the abandoned event does not continue
                with the decision of the organizer within 48 hours after its
                starting, https://www.{Settings.siteTitle}.io will settle all
                determined markets that were completed on the pitch. In
                addition, https://www.{Settings.siteTitle}.io will cancel
                another and refund the stakes to players. There are exceptions
                to the general rule: The 48 hours rule is not supported in the
                Tennis games. All bets are available until the referee or
                official representative determines the winner. Nevertheless,
                there are cases in which a player retires. In this situation,
                all markets that are determined on the court are settled
                accordingly and all the rest declared void and stakes returned
                to players. If there are any doubts about the retirement of a
                player before the last point is concluded, the market of the
                match winner is cancelled. Nevertheless, all markets that relate
                to the specific sets or games that are determined, are settled
                accordingly. Baseball games. The 48 hours rule is supported.
                When two teams are playing 2 games in a row they are considered
                as Game 1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically
                played with all bets valid.For the avoidance of doubt, if Team A
                plays Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets
                offered on Game 1 as originally scheduled and the result of Game
                2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as originally
                scheduled. The 48 hours rule is valid. (e.g. if a football match
                is abandoned in the second half, the markets of the first half
                will be settled normally). (e.g. in the example above, the
                markets of the second match have not decided) will be void and
                stakes will be refunded to customers.{" "}

                17.9. Explanation of specific Betting Types If there is at least
                one Scorer when the match is abandoned, all bets made on the
                first Goalscorer will be applied and on the last will be

                Head 2 Head Bets These bets mean the prediction about taking the
                higher position, getting more points or results between two
                players. Head 2 Head bets will work if both players will do the
                best in the event. If two players get the same result or play
                out a draw, all bets will be void. Outright Bets These bets mean
                the prediction about taking the higher position, getting more
                points or results among the players (3+). Outright bets will
                work if all participants will actively take part in the event.
                If there are participants that do not take part in the event,
                all odds that were placed on other participants will be amended
                and settled with a reduction in the odds. The reduction includes
                the same margin applied to the missing participants. If two or
                more participants take the same result (play in a draw), the
                applicable odds will be equal to the accepted odds divided by
                the number of tie participants (e.g. with equal odds 2.70 and
                three tie participants the final odds will be: 2.70 / 3 = 0.90),
                unless the official representative chooses only one winner with
                an additional statistic criterion (e.g. assists). Booking

                one card and the red - two. If a player gets two yellow cards in
                a row that are changed into a red card, this counts as three
                cards. In general, a player cannot receive more than three
                cards. A settlement will be based on all available card data
                that will appear during the normal event’s playing time. The
                cards are shown after the final whilst won’t be considered. The

                that have already been replaced, coaches, players on the bench
                who have not taken part in the game) will not be considered.
                Booking markets with points In general, a player cannot get over
                35 points during the game. A yellow card brings 10 points, the
                red one is counted as 25 points, and the second yellow-red card–
                25. The second yellow card for a player who leads to a red card
                is not counted. Corners The corners are considered for the
                relevant market settlement only if they have been taken. If the
                corner is given but not taken, it will not be counted. Intervals
                The period from 00:01 until the completion of the minute
                indicated as the end minute is stated as the first interval. To
                exclude doubts, the interval 1-15 min is considered the period
                from 00:01 to 15:00 and the interval 30-45 min is considered the
                period from 30:01 until the end of the First Half accordingly.
